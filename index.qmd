# Introduction

`lidR` is an R package for manipulating and visualizing airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with an emphasis on research & development for forestry and ecology applications. The package is entirely open source and is integrated within the geospatial R ecosystem (i.e., `raster/terra/stars` and `sp/sf`). This guide has been written to help both the ALS novice and seasoned point cloud processing veterans. Key functionality of `lidR` includes functions to:

-   Read and write `.las` and `.laz` files and render customized point-cloud displays (chapter [-@sec-io])
-   Process point clouds, including point classification (chapter [-@sec-gnd]), digital terrain models (chapter [-@sec-dtm]), normalization (chapter [-@sec-norm]), and digital surface models (chapter [-@sec-chm])
-   Perform individual tree segmentation (chapter [-@sec-itd-its])
-   Compute standard metrics at different levels of regularization (chapters [-@sec-metrics], [-@sec-cba], [-@sec-aba], [-@sec-tba], [-@sec-vba], [-@sec-pba])
-   Manage processing for sets of point-cloud files - referred to as a `LAScatalog` (chapters [-@sec-engine], [-@sec-engine2])
-   Implement guidelines for area-based approaches to forest modeling using ALS data (chapter [-@sec-modeling-aba])
-   Facilitate user-defined processing streams for research and development (chapter [-@sec-outbox])
-   Understand spatial indexing (chapter [-@sec-spatial-indexing])
-   Discover the plugin system (chapter [-@sec-plugins])

# Development

The current release version of `lidR` can be found on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lidR/), and the source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/r-lidar/lidR). Development of the `lidR` package was made possible thanks to the financial support of:

-   **2015-2018:** the AWARE project [NSERC CRDPJ 462973-14](https://aware.forestry.ubc.ca/); grantee [Prof. Nicholas C. Coops](https://profiles.forestry.ubc.ca/person/nicholas-coops/) and [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/en).
-   **2018-2021:** the financial support of the [Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs of Québec](https://mffp.gouv.qc.ca/) and [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/en).
-   **2021-2024:** [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/en).

Since 2024, the `lidR` package (as well as the [`lasR`](https://github.com/r-lidar/lasR) package) is no longer supported by Laval University. While the software will remain free and open-source, `r-lidar` has transitioned into a company to ensure sustainability. We now offer independent services for training courses, consulting, and development. For more information, please visit our website: [r-lidar.com](https://www.r-lidar.com/).

# Other Lidar Packages

For a package focused on production rather than R&D, the reader can look at the [`lasR`](https://github.com/r-lidar/lasR) package, which is not covered in this book. The `lasR` package is much more powerful than `lidR` and is designed to process terabytes of data. However, the counterpart is that it does not allow easy and handy manipulation of the point cloud in R like `lidR`. Both tools tagert different usages.

# Installation

In R simply type:

```r
install.packages("lidR")
```

For linux user you need some external libraries

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev libgeos++-dev libudunits2-dev libproj-dev libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libfreetype6-dev libxt-dev libfftw3-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gdal-devel geos-devel udunits2-devel proj-devel mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel freetype-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel
```
